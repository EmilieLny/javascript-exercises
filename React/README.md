| What is the function and purpose of the Virtual DOM in React?                   | The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It allows React to perform updates and calculations efficiently before applying changes to the real DOM, improving performance.                                                                |
| What is a ref in React?                                                         | A ref is a way to access and interact with DOM nodes or React elements directly.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Why would you not want to use refs too much in React?                           | Overusing refs can make code harder to understand and maintain, and goes against React's declarative programming model.                                                                                                                                 |
| Why would you not want to use Redux in a React application?                     | Redux adds complexity and boilerplate code, which may be unnecessary for smaller applications or when simpler state management solutions suffice.                                                                                                       |
| Can you use TypeScript in the browser?                                          | No, TypeScript cannot be directly executed in the browser. It needs to be compiled to JavaScript first.                                                                                                                                                 |
| When TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, can there still be errors?           | Yes, runtime errors can still occur in the compiled JavaScript, as TypeScript only catches type-related errors during compilation.                                                                                                                      |
| What is the purpose of the `key` prop in React lists?                           | The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in lists, improving rendering performance.                                                                                                                    |
| What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React? | Controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components maintain their own internal state.                                                                                                                               |
| What is the purpose of React.memo()?                                            | React.memo() is a higher-order component that can be used to optimize functional components by memoizing the result and preventing unnecessary re-renders.                                                                                              |
| What is the difference between `useState` and `useRef`?                         | `useState` triggers a re-render when the state changes, while `useRef` doesn't cause a re-render when its value changes.                                                                                                                                |
| What is the purpose of the `useEffect` cleanup function?                        | The cleanup function in `useEffect` is used to perform any necessary cleanup (like cancelling subscriptions or timers) when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again.                                                                     |
| What is the difference between `React.createElement` and JSX?                   | `React.createElement` is a function that creates React elements, while JSX is a syntax extension that gets transformed into `React.createElement` calls during compilation. Note: JSX = Syntax & `React.createElement` = func that create React element |
| What is the purpose of React Portals?                                           | React Portals allow rendering a component's children into a different part of the DOM tree, useful for modals, tooltips, etc.                                                                                                                           |
| What is the difference between `props.children` and `props.render`?             | `props.children` is used for component composition, while `props.render` (render props pattern) is a function prop used for sharing code between components.                                                                                            |
